# Fire Dice: A Discord Bot for TTRPG Dice Rolling

Fire Dice is a Discord bot designed to enhance your tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It provides a fast and efficient way to roll dice, making your gaming experience smoother and more enjoyable. Currently, Fire Dice is in its early stages of development, but I'm working hard to add more features and improve its functionality.

## Available Commands

- `/r`: Roll the dice. Use the following structure to roll: `/r 1d20` or `/r 5d6`. This command will roll a 20-sided die once or a 5-sided die five times, respectively.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling**: Fire Dice can roll any number of dice with any number of sides, making it versatile for all your TTRPG needs.

- **Attribute Storage** (Under Development): In the future, Fire Dice will be able to store attributes that will automatically be added to your roll. This feature will make character management easier and gameplay faster.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and improve Fire Dice. We're excited to bring you a more efficient and enjoyable TTRPG experience!
